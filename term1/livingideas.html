    <em>one day, one brief, one prothesis.</em> <br />
    in this course held by Saúl Baeza we approached differents visions and works on perceiving and being perceived. 
  </p>

    <h2>.01 to become something else</h2>
    <p>
       On the first day, Saúl showed us his work with prothesis. I really enjoyed the way he showed us that prothesis can be objects (and so much more) to resist and protest. I never thought of it that way, so it opened up a lot of questions for me. 
Some interesting ones that came up in class were: What is a prothesis? Is my phone a prothesis of my body? Am I a prothesis of the world? <br>
After that, we had an awesome lecture from Manel de Aguas, a cyborg with weather sensory fins in his head that let him hear changes in atmospheric pressure, humidity, and temperature. <br>
Then we read the article "The Fetishization of "Natural" is Old News with Dr. Naomi" by Vision By and talked about it as a group. <br>
    </p>
     <h2>.01 prototype</h2>
    <p> For my prosthesis prototype, I started doing some research and thinking about how our brains instantly understand other people's faces. <br>
      As someone who rely so much on other's people expression, almost obsessively, I wish I could stop my brain sometimes. Or at least, to slow down that perception. <br>
      The question I raised was: <strong> what about a prosthesis tha slows down the first perception?</strong> <br>
      I started playing with clay on my face, focusing on the facial features that define gender and how to obscure them.<br>

    <p> Then switched (for the first time ever) to <strong> TouchDesigner</strong> and started to play around and try to pixelate my face through the real time webcam. I wanted to understand if it was possible to slowly see myself again - without any pixel - while the time was passing (the last part didn't work cause again: it was my first time on TD ihihih but that was the idea).

    <h2>.02 to become something else</h2>
    <p>
      Qui ho messo in discussione il concetto di “me stessa” come costante.
      Attraverso l’uso di oggetti e materiali alternativi, ho giocato con la possibilità di diventare altro — un’estensione artificiale, ma anche un modo diverso di percepire.

  <section class="project-section">
    <h2>.03 detective and subject</h2>
    <p>
      In questa fase finale mi sono posta come osservatrice e soggetto allo stesso tempo.
      Il processo è diventato un’indagine visiva e concettuale: osservare, interpretare e documentare la trasformazione, fino a non sapere più chi osserva e chi è osservato.
